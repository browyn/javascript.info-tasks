# JavaScript.info Exercises Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises given at the end of each chapter on the [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/) website. Each chapter's exercises are organized into individual folders, with each folder containing a README file that provides an overview of the exercise and its solution.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured by chapter, with each chapter having its own directory. Inside each chapter directory, you'll find:

- Folders for each exercise.
- Each exercise folder contains a README file and the solution file(s).

Here is an example structure:

```
JavaScript.info-Exercises-Solutions/ │ ├── Chapter-1/ │   ├── Exercise-1/ │   │   ├── README.md │   │   └── solution.js │   ├── Exercise-2/ │   │   ├── README.md │   │   └── solution.js │   └── ... │ ├── Chapter-2/ │   ├── Exercise-1/ │   │   ├── README.md │   │   └── solution.js │   ├── Exercise-2/ │   │   ├── README.md │   │   └── solution.js │   └── ... │ └── ...
```

## Chapters

Each chapter directory includes:

- **Exercise Folders:** Each folder is named `Exercise-X`, where `X` is the exercise number. 
  - **README.md:** This file provides an overview of the exercise and any important notes or explanations related to the solution.
  - **Solution File(s):** The solution to the exercise, typically named `solution.js` or similar.
